            <p class="mt-3 font-light">Preceding the "Everything Procedural Conference", Breda University of Applied Sciences will host a one-day SideFX Houdini
                Masterclass by Simon Verstraete on Thursday, April 21st 2022. During this Masterclass you will learn how to build and use procedural tools for
                game development – using the assets from SideFX’s Project Titan. This full-day workshop starts by showing how to use the tools in-game engine,
                then takes you into Houdini to teach you how to make your own procedural tools.</p>

            <h4 class="font-bold text-xl mt-4">Takeaway</h4>
            <p class="mt-1 font-light">You will have a better understanding on how to make and use procedural game tools for use in Unreal Engine.</p>

            <h4 class="font-bold text-xl mt-4">Audience</h4>
            <p class="mt-1 font-light">This workshop is for anyone interested in using more Houdini in their game workflows. This will focus on the basics of that.</p>

            <h4 class="font-bold text-xl mt-4">Prerequisites</h4>
            <p class="mt-1 font-light">Knowing the basics of Houdini, like navigation and being familiar with node-based workflows. You need to bring your own hardware (laptop is
                sufficient) to be able to actively participate. Make sure Houdini, SideFX Labs, Unreal Engine 5 and Houdini Engine are installed.</p>
