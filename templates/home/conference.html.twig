In this talk, Mark will outline techniques for generating *all* items within a game - from books to weapons, from gemstones to spices, or from armour to coinage. Through the case study of experimental roguelike game "Ultime Ratio Regum" he will explore some of his techniques for doing this; how to create a shared "look" for generated items from similar cultures; why some categories of items might be more or less PCG-able than others, and the player experience of a world of solely generated items.',
